# Binary_trees

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

#### Functions Descriptions

* [binary_tree_node](0-binary_tree_node.c) - Create a new node, it can be the root node.
* [binary_tree_insert_left](1-binary_tree_insert_left.c) - Create a node as the left-child of another node.
* [binary_tree_insert_right](2-binary_tree_insert_right.c) - Create a node as the right-child of another node.
* [binary_tree_delete](3-binary_tree_delete.c) - Deletes an entire binary tree.
* [binary_tree_is_leaf](4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c) - Checks if a node is a leaf.
* [binary_tree_is_root](5-binary_tree_is_root.c) - Checks if a node is a root.
* [binary_tree_preorder](6-binary_tree_preorder.c) - Goes trought the tree using pre-order transversal.
* [binary_tree_inorder](7-binary_tree_inorder.c) - Goes trought the tree using inorder transversal.
* [binary_tree_postorder](8-binary_tree_postorder.c) - Goes trought the tree using postorder transversal.
* [binary_tree_height](9-binary_tree_height.c) - Return the tree height.
* [binary_tree_depth](10-binary_tree_depth.c) - Return the depth of a node.
